# SpamEmailClassifier
A spam email classifier in machine learning is a model designed to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam emails. The classifier uses various machine learning algorithms to learn from labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails and then applies this knowledge to automatically classify new, unseen emails as either spam or ham.
